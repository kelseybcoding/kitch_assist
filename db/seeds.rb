#   	title: "Lemon Butter Chicken", 
#   	servings: "6",
#   	prep_time: "15 minutes",
#   	cook_time: "15 minutes", 
#     instructions: "1. Start by butterflying the chicken breasts, but cut all the way through to get 2 pieces. 2. Pound each piece of chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap with a meat mallet until chicken is about 1/4-inch thick. 3. Mix the 1/2 cup flour and the 1/2 tsp salt to make the seasoned flour. Place on a plate for easy dredging. 4. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour, sprinkle with lemon pepper seasoning and set aside. 5. Mix the lemon juice and wine together; set aside. 6. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 7. Add the butter–it’s OK if it begins to brown, that is part of the flavor. 8. Working in batches, brown 2-3 pieces of chicken for 3 minutes each side or until nicely brown and chicken juices run clear. 9. Remove from pan and keep warm in a 200 degree F oven. Repeat until all chicken is browned. 10. In the same pan, brown the lemon slices on both sides. Add the chicken back to the pan with the lemon slices. 11. Drizzle lemon juice mixture over chicken and let sauce reduce slightly (about 3 minutes). 12. Serve with the browned lemon slices–they taste wonderful!"

#     title: "Chicken Pumpkin Thai Curry", 
#     servings: "3-4",
#     prep_time: "20 minutes",
#     cook_time: "15 minutes", 
#     instructions: "1. Start by making the aromatic base. In a food processor, combine the garlic, shallots, ginger, and lemongrass. Pulse to start breaking down the aromatics into very fine pieces. Add 1 tablespoon of water to get everything moving. You may need to add another 1-3 teaspoons of water beyond that to end up with a paste. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the food processor so you get all the bits. Note: A mini food processor will work best but you can do it in a normal-sized one as well. You can also do this job with a mortar and pestle, but it'll take you some time to grind it all down. Reserve 3 tablespoons of this mixture for the recipe and refrigerate or freeze the other half for the next time you make a Thai curry. 2. In a large pot over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon coconut oil. Once it starts to shimmer, add 3 tablespoons of the aromatic base from above and 2 tablespoons red curry paste. Stir and cook this with the oil until it starts to smell amazing, about 30 seconds. 3. Then, add the squash or pumpkin, coconut milk and fish sauce. Bring the coconut milk to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook the squash just until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Then, add the chicken and cook 5 more minutes or until it's no longer pink and cooked through. 4. Garnish with lime wedges and sliced Thai basil or cilantro."

#     title: "Smokey Beanless Chili",
#     servings: "6-8",
#     prep_time: "30 minutes",
#     cook_time: "5 hours",
#     instructions: "1. The first thing you'll need to do is cook the bacon. My favorite method is to bake it: Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Lay the bacon in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake for about 12 to 15 minutes or until the bacon is just crisp. The exact time will depend on the thickness of your bacon, so watch it carefully because it can burn in a blink. Once the bacon is done, remove it from the tray and chop it. Refrigerate and save for a garnish. 2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, pour the leftover bacon fat from baking the bacon. Add the ground beef, sea salt, smoked paprika, chili powder, and ground chipotle pepper. Stir often while cooking until the beef is cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes. While the beef is cooking, I like to prep the onion, sweet potato, and butternut squash. 3. In your slow cooker, combine the diced onion, sweet potato, and butternut squash. Add the cooked, seasoned ground beef. On top of this, add the fire-roasted diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and fish sauce. The fish sauce gives a savory flavor that adds a nice backbone of umami. It's optional, but I highly recommend it. 4. Stir all the ingredients until combined, then set the slow cooker to low for 5 to 6 hours. Stir once or twice through the cooking process if you can. 5. Adjust the seasoning with black pepper and sea salt, then top with sliced green onion. Serve next to a green side salad for a complete meal."

#     title: "Fried Plantains with Cinnamon",
#     servings: "1",
#     prep_time: "2 minutes",
#     cook_time: "5 minutes",
#     instructions: "1. Peel the plantain and slice into 1/4-inch rounds. I like to cut mine on a diagonal. 2. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high and add the ghee or coconut oil. Fry the plantains until golden brown, 2-3 minutes each side. Be careful because they'll burn easily. 3. Remove from the heat and dust with cinnamon and a sprinkle of sea salt."

#     title: "Orange Ginger Chicken Wings",
#     servings: "1.5 pounds",
#     prep_time: "20 minutes",
#     cook_time: "40 minutes",
#     instructions: "1. Preheat the oven to 375C. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. 2. Prepare the sauce in a small saucepan: Remove the zest from one orange using a microplane or grater, then add the juice of both oranges to the pan. Grate about 1 tbsp of ginger into the juice using the microplane. Add the apple cider vinegar, honey, coconut aminos, salt, and minced serrano pepper. Remove the seeds and inner pith of the pepper for a milder flavor. 3. Simmer the glaze on medium-low heat until it reduces and thickens, coating the back of a spoon. This may take several minutes. 4. Meanwhile, add the coconut oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken wings dry with a paper towel and fry on each side to crisp / brown the skin a bit. Remove and drain on some clean paper towels. 5. In a large bowl, toss the wings with the orange-ginger glaze. Remove wings from the glaze with a slotted spoon. Arrange wings on the baking sheet and save any excess glaze. 6. Bake for 15 min, remove from oven, flip them over and baste with glaze. 7. Bake for 15 more min or until completely cooked through. 8. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and EAT."
