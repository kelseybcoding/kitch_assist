  {instructions: "For the Brine:\r\n\r\nDirections\r\nTo make the brining solution, dissolve the salt and sugar in 2 gallons of cold water in a nonreactive container (such as a clean bucket or large stockpot, or a clean, heavy-duty, food grade plastic storage bag). Add the oranges, lemons, thyme, and rosemary. Note: if you have a big turkey and need more brine than this, use 1/2 cup salt and 1/2 cup brown sugar for every gallon of water. \r\n\r\nRemove the neck, giblets, and liver from the cavity of the turkey and reserve for the gravy. Rinse the turkey inside and out under cold running water. \r\n\r\nSoak the turkey in the brine, covered and refrigerated, for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. \r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F. \r\n\r\nRemove the turkey from the brine and rinse well under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels both inside and out. Place turkey, breast side up, in a large, heavy roasting pan. Rub breast side with orange segments and rub on all sides with the butter, stuffing some underneath the skin. Season lightly inside and out with salt and pepper. Stuff the turkey with the onion, remaining orange, celery, carrot, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, sage and parsley. Loosely tie the drumsticks together with kitchen string. Roast the turkey, uncovered, breast side down for 1 hour. \r\n\r\nRemove from the oven, turn, and baste with 1/2 cup stock. Continue roasting with the breast side up until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 165 degrees F when inserted into the largest section of thigh (avoiding the bone), about 2 3/4 to 3 hours total cooking time. Baste the turkey once every hour with 1/2 to 3/4 cup chicken or turkey stock. \r\n\r\nRemove from the oven and place on a platter. Tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 20 minutes before carving. \r\n\r\nFor the turkey broth:\r\nHeat the oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the turkey neck, heart, and gizzard to the pan and saute until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add the chopped vegetables and bay leaf to the pan and saute until soft, about 2 minutes. Pour the stock and 3 cups of water into the pan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the stock is reduced to 4 cups, about 1 hour, adding the chopped liver to the pan during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Strain the stock into a clean pot or large measuring cup. Pull the meat off the neck, chop the neck meat and giblets, and set aside. \r\n\r\nFor the pan gravy:\r\nPour the reserved turkey pan juices into a glass-measuring cup and skim off the fat. \r\n\r\nPlace the roasting pan on 2 stovetop burners over medium heat add the pan juice and 1 cup turkey broth and the white wine to the pan, and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the remaining 3 cup of broth and bring to a simmer, then transfer to a measuring cup. In a large heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium high heat. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, to make a light roux. Add the hot stock, whisking constantly, then simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nAdd the reserved neck meat and giblets to the pan and adjust seasoning, to taste, with salt and black pepper. Pour into a gravy boat and serve.

(You may not use all 2 gallons, but in any case, reserve 3 cupsful to use as directed below.

  {instructions: "Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl to combine. Pour buttermilk and milk into 2-cup measuring cup. Mix yolk with melted butter, then beat into milk mixture until well blended. Whisk egg white in large bowl to stiff peaks. Make a well in center of dry ingredients in bowl; dump wet ingredients into dry ingredients all at once and whisk gently until just combined (a few lumps should remain). Do not over mix. Quickly, but gently, fold egg white into batter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, heat a heavy-bottomed skillet or seasoned griddle over medium-high heat. (If using an electric griddle, heat to 375 degrees F.) Test skillet by sprinkling a few drops of water on it. When water forms beads and dances over skillet surface, it is hot enough. Lightly grease the skillet with bacon grease, vegetable oil, or spray with nonstick cooking spray.\r\n\r\nLadle 1/4 cup batter onto skillet for each pancake, making sure not to overcrowd. Scatter about 1 tablespoon blueberries evenly over each pancake. Cook pancakes until bottoms are golden brown and large bubbles begin to appear on top surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spatula, flip pancakes and cook until remaining side has browned, 1 to 2 minutes longer (cooking the second side takes only about half as long as the first side and doesn't brown as evenly as the first side). Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to skillet as necessary. The pancakes are best served immediately but may be kept warm (* see note) in a low (200 degree F) oven until all the batter has been cooked. \r\n\r\nServe with butter and your favorite warmed syrup, or your favorite fruit compote, or dust with confectioners' sugar.\r\n\r\nServes 3 to 4 (makes about eight 3-inch pancakes).\r\n\r\n\r\n* Note:  To keep pancakes warm  Place a large cooling rack (sprayed with vegetable cooking spray) on a sheet pan. Place the pan and the rack in a 200-degree oven. Place pancakes on the rack in a single layer, uncovered, for up to 20 minutes (any longerthey will start to dry out.) The warm oven keeps the pancakes hot enough to melt a pat of butter, and leaving the pancakes uncovered keeps them from becoming soggy. \r\n\r\n\r\n Cooks Notes \r\nWhen making the batter, take care not to overmix it, as too much stirring will develop the gluten in the flour and result in tough pancakes.\r\n\r\nHave the milk and egg at room temperature so the melted butter doesn't harden.\r\n\r\nA batter that's too thick can result in pancakes that are raw and wet in the middle. To avoid this, make the batter with just enough liquid so that it spreads into a pancake that is thin enough to cook through. Feel free to adjust the batter by adding more milk so that it flows off the ladle like very thick cream. Also, make sure the skillet is made of heavy-gauge metal that conducts heat well and evenly and that the skillet is heated up completely before cooking. \r\n\r\nIf the tops of the pancakes bubble and the bottoms don't brown, the heat source is too low, if they brown before they bubble, the heat is too high.\r\n\r\nFor more flavor  if serving pancakes with bacon (or, if you have bacon grease), reserve the bacon drippings to grease the skillet instead of oil.\r\n\r\nWhen fresh blueberries are not in season, frozen wild blueberries are a good substitute. To make sure that frozen berries do not bleed, rinse them under cool water in a mesh strainer until the water runs clear, then spread them on a paper towel-lined plate to dry.", total_time: 0, title: "Perfect Blueberry Pancakes", source_id: "166038", yield_unit: "Servings", description: "The taste of hot blueberries exploding through tender, fluffy, sweet pancakes makes for a glorious breakfast and a guaranteed great start to the day, These pancakes are easy to make, fluffy, and totally addictive.

Turn the machine on again and slowly pour in the olive oil, just to combine. Reserve.\r\n\r\n2 Cook the bacon in a large pan — you will be searing the roulade in this later, so it needs to be wide — over medium-low heat until it is about half-cooked. You want it cooked, but still limp. Do not crisp it up or it will break when you try to wrap it inside the roulade. When the bacon is ready, set it aside on paper towels.\r\n\r\n3 Place heavy duty plastic wrap (or two layers of plastic wrap) on a large work surface and place the flank steak on it. Cover with more plastic wrap. Using a rubber mallet, the flat side of a meat mallet or an empty wine bottle, pound the flank steak until it is 1/2 inch thick or thinner. Flip the meat from time to time to pound everything evenly. Once the meat is as thin as you want it, if you have a meat mallet with a tenderizing side (the pointy side), remove the plastic wrap and pound this on both sides for a minute or two. If you don't have a meat mallet, you can skip this step.\r\n\r\n4 Look at your steak: You will be rolling it up with the grain of the meat facing side to side. You do this because when you slice it later, the beef will be more tender when you cut across the grain. Arrange the meat until the grain faces side to side, and if it is not squarish or rectangular, cut it to fit. Sprinkle on some salt and black pepper.\r\n\r\n5 Spread a thin layer of pesto on the meat, leaving about 1/2 inch free on all sides of the meat. Lay down the bacon against the grain of the beef. Preheat the oven to 350°F.\r\n\r\n6 Carefully roll  the roulade up tightly, as you would a carpet. If you want, cut off any bacon that is extending beyond the steak. Tie off the meat with 6 to 8 lengths of string, each about an inch or so apart. Sear the tied roulade in the pan with the bacon fat. You want to quickly brown the surface, not cook the inside of the roulade.\r\n\r\n7 Put the roulade in a roasting pan on a rack, seam side down. If you don't have a rack, improvise with celery stalks. Roast this for 20-25 minutes, or until the interior of the meat is 130°F. (Note that the ends of the roulade will be far hotter than the center — so always test the temperature from the center of the roulade.)\r\n\r\n8 Remove the meat from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Slice the roulade so each serving is wrapped in string. You can either let everyone cut their own string at the table, or cut it yourself and secure the roulades with toothpicks if you want.

Beat the egg into the milk and stir  them into the dry ingredients to make a smooth, soft dough. Quickly knead it on a lightly floured board, no more than 1 minute, and roll it out to 1/2 or 3/4 inch thick. With the sharp edge of a glass or biscuit cutter, cut the dough into 2-1/2 inch circles and place them well apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.

Combine half the blueberries (2 cups) in a pot with the sugar, lemon juice,  zest, ginger, and half the rum. Cover and bring to a gentle boil. Make a  paste with the remaining rum and cornstarch and stir it into hot berry  mixture. Return it again to the boil, remove the pan from the heat, and  stir until the liquid has thickened. Cool the mixture, then stir in the  remaining berries. Taste carefully to see if it needs more seasoning. Set  aside.    Whip the cream until stiff and sweeten to taste with confectioners sugar.  Unless you are serving it right away, cover and chill.    Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Bake the shortcake for 12 to 15 minutes,  until they are just done.

Insert a sharp knife between the meat  and the rib bones, separating the meat from the ribs in one large piece to  slice the beef into boneless slices or simply carve into rib portions, each  with a bone attached. Carve the boneless meat into 1/2-inch thick slices.  This recipe yields 5 to 8 servings.

Drizzle with the oil, and season with salt. Wrap the garlic in the foil and seal closed to make pouches. Grill over indirect medium heat (or roast in a 400 degree F oven) until tender and any juices that escape are deep brown, about 30 to 40 minutes. Let the garlic cool. Squeeze the roasted cloves from the papery skins, and mash to a paste. Blend with the butter; pipe, shape, or store as desired in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or the freezer for up to 3 weeks. Makes 1 cup.\r\n\r\nTo make (optional) Scallion Butter:\r\nBlend all the ingredients together; pipe, shape, or store as desired in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or the freezer for up to 3 weeks. Makes 1 cup.\r\n\r\nTo make Cedar-Planked Salmon:\r\nPreheat a gas grill to medium-high heat, approximately 425 degrees F. If you are using a charcoal grill, build a fire and let it burn down until the coals are glowing red with a light coating of white ash. Spread the coals in an even bed. Clean the cooking grate.\r\n\r\nClean, dry and trim the salmon. Check for bones and use clean needle-nose pliers to remove any you find. Cut the salmon into 8 equal pieces. Salt and pepper to taste. Spread a little brown sugar evenly over the top and dot with little chunks of butter, use more or less to your taste.\r\n\r\nWhen grill comes to heat, remove soaking cedar planks from their water bath and shake dry. Place soaked planks in the center of the heated grill to pre-heat for about 5-10 minutes with lid closed, or until they begin to crackle and smoke. This will lightly toast the wood and a distinct smell of cedar will be evident. Open the grill and quickly brush the top surface of heated planks with a thin coating of olive oil, being careful not to drip oil down the sides. Place 4 prepared salmon fillets on top of each pre-heated and oiled cedar plank. Close grill lid and cook at 425 degrees F until just cooked through, about 20-30 minutes (cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the fillet), or until the internal temperature of the fillet reaches 135 degrees F. Do not turn the salmon, and be careful not to overcook. When done, the fish should be moist, opaque and flaking easily in the middle.\r\n\r\nCheck flame level periodically to make sure the planks do not ignite. Have a spray bottle of water on hand to spritz planks in case they do, but it is much less likely to happen if they have been well soaked beforehand. \r\n\r\nWhen done, carefully remove the hot planked salmon from grill and place onto a heatproof platter or trivet on your table, serve directly from the plank.\r\n\r\nServe the salmon with your favorite compound butter and freshly squeezed lemon juice, if desired.
